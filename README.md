# hackvoid-code
A custom code made for hackvoid protocol. Write it and compile it to HTML.

A documentation for the code is a work-in-progress. Should be in a wiki-style web app or in a nicely formatted HTML form.

**NOTICE: Do not use this code and compiler ir ANY production environment! There is no stable version YET! Everything is still in early developement and should be tested for any bugs / glitches / misformatting / etc.**

# Idea
The idea of this project is to create a custom code capable of the same things as html - but better. In the future, this code will be able to create templates, do arithmetics, hold and execute custom functions and more. This code won't be a replacement for standart html. It will be like a framework for easier and more structured working. Also, this code will be the main web code for hackvoid protocol.

# Usage
Simple usage: python3 compiler.py <input_file> <output_file>

Help menu: python3 compiler.py
